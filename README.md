# Image-Processing-Computer-Vision assignments
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the course Image Processing & Computer Vision I took at the University of Twente. The course covers basic and advanced image processing and computer vision techniques. It featured four individual assignments and one larger final group project. The material in this repository can be valuable for students or learners interested in the topic.

## Assignment 1
Restore a distorted image using convolution and the Fourier Transform.

## Assignment 2
Stitch together four overlapping images of a nautical map to create a single geometrically correct image. This requires computing the correct projective transformation for the input images.

## Assignment 3
Develop and evaluate software for an image processing system that is able to measure the diameters of a blood vessel in coronary angiographic images. Specifically, we filter the input image to remove noise, and we compare Canny and Marr-Hildreth algorithms for edge detection.

## Assignment 4
Produce a one minute video demonstrating various computer vision techniques, including blurring, smoothing, edge detection, Fourier Transform, template matching, optical flow tracking. For the final 'freestyle' part of the video, I develop a custom algorithm that is able to count the total value of a of a set of coins from a video.

## Project
Employ computer vision tools to track a man overboard in a video taken from a boat. This complex task involves the use of advanced techniques for camera calibration, video frame stabilization, object detection, and tracking. Our algorithm precisely tracks the target, understands when the target is hidden behind the waves, and estimates its distance from the boat.
